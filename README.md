# HRMate
The HRMate is a desktop application I developed with the goal of simplifying and automating the management of employee records within an organization. 
The main objective was to create a user-friendly and secure system that serves as a central hub where HR personnel can efficiently handle tasks such as adding new employees, updating existing records, viewing employee details, and removing records when employees leave the organization. 
By centralizing this data, the system helps ensure that all employee information is accurate, secure, and easily accessible.
